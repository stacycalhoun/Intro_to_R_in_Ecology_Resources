# Intro_to_R_in_Ecology_resources

These materials were developed and compiled as part of a mini project for the Level 2 Teaching Certification Program in the biology department at UL Lafayette. When I was the TA for Wildlife Ecology and Management lab, we had the students working with code in R. I noticed throughout the semester that the students would have difficulty with some aspects of coding--most of them stemming from not understanding or being directly introduced to certain coding basics. The feedback I received in my teaching evaluations also reflected that the students would have preferred a larger foundation in R before they started coding themselves. This experience drove me to develop and compile these tools so that ecology courses that have a coding component would have a resource that can be used out of the box or be tailored as needed. I also tried to keep most of the exercises general enough that application to other fields in biology can be done with only minor revisions.   

This is a collection of resources for introducing students to coding in R. While this is not a comprehensive collection of 
resources, it is designed to be a jumping off point for professors/instructors to build off of when introducing R to 
their students. The documents saved within this repository are intended to be used as an introduction to R for a course or lab that has a coding component but in which the students may not have had any coding experience.

The 'Installation and Introduction to Rstudio' pdf has instructions for downloading R and Rstudio, references Rstudio cloud as an option for students without laptops, and provides a bit of an orientation to some of the commonly used buttons and menus in Rstudio. Additionally, some helpful links to more coding resources are included at the end of the document.

The Intro to R in Ecology lab exercise introduces some basic coding concepts and is designed to have the instructor walk through the exercise with the students so that additional instructions outside of those provided and/or tailoring of the code or concepts for the specific course can be made.

Cheat sheets for basic R and ggplot2 were downloaded from the rstudio website under the resources->cheatsheets tabs.
