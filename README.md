# R_resources
This is a collection of resources for introducing students to coding in R. While this is not a comprehensive collection of 
resources, it is designed to be a jumping off point for professors/instructors to build off of when introducing R to 
their students. 

The documents saved within this repository are intended to be used as an introduction to R for a course or lab that has
a coding component.

The Intro to R lab exercise introduces some basic coding concepts and is designed to have the instructor walk through it
with the students so that additional instructions and/or tailoring of the code or concepts for the specific course can be made.

Cheat sheets are downloaded from the rstudio website under the resources->cheatsheets tabs.
